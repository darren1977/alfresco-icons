# Alfresco icons

Alfresco icons are a font icon set.

## Preproduction

**Note:** This is a work in progress and not intended for production use.

## Getting Started

### Using a font collection

The iconfont folder contains pre-generated font files that can be included in a project. This is especially convenient for the web; however, it is generally better to link to the web font hosted by Alfresco:

```
<link href="https://fonts.alfresco.com/icon?family=Alfresco+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
```

## License

These icons are made available under the Apache License Version 2.0. Feel free to remix and re-share these icons and documentation in your products. We'd love attribution in your app's about screen, but it's not required. The only thing we ask is that you not re-sell these icons.
